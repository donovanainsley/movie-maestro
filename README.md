Movie Maestro is a quiz game for movie enthusiasts where each question is infused with a touch of nostalgia. There are 10 questions to answer, all about movies. Play and then challenge yourself to beat your top score by playing again.

## User Experience (UX)

- ### User Stories

  - **First Time User Goals**

    1. As a first time user, I want to know what the quiz is about and how to play.
    1. As a first time user, I want the quiz to be fun and engaging.
    1. As a first time user, I want to navigate through the quiz quickly and easily.

  - **Returning User Goals**

    1. As a returning user, I want to view my previous scores so that I may improve them.
    1. As a returning user, I'd like there to be a large pool of questions available to keep the game challenging and replayable.

  - **Frequent User Goals**

    - Frequent user goals would be the same as a returning user, due to the basic nature of the quiz.

- ### Design

  - #### Colour Scheme

  The main colours used are white, caramel, school bus yellow, penn red and space cadet. I chose these colours after finding the background image for the website [here](https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/videotape-with-clapperboard-3d-glasses_4305082.htm?query=video%20tape%20with%20popcorns#from_view=detail_alsolike) and it triggered a thought to the Quinten Tarantino movies Kill Bill and Pulp fiction, which is when I decided to google and then use the Pulp Fiction colour palette throughout the webste.

  - #### Typography

    - The Merriweather font is the main font used throughout the website excluding the heading which is Rubik Mono One, which I stumbled across when using google fonts and thought it was brilliant for a header. I chose Merriweather after Googling the best Google fonts for websites and come across an article by Newbird which can be found [here](https://newbird.com/best-google-fonts-to-use-on-your-website/) where it was selected 1st of the 8 best Google fonts. As Merriweather is a Serif style font, I chose Sans-Serif as a backup font as it is considered the most web-safe font for readability.

  - #### Imagery

    - The background image was found on Freepik [here](https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/videotape-with-clapperboard-3d-glasses_4305082.htm?query=video%20tape%20with%20popcorns#from_view=detail_alsolike).

    - The favicon was found from a google search for "clapperboard favicon" and can be found [here](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/clapperboard_371869?term=film+clapper&page=1&position=34&origin=tag&related_id=371869).

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

### First Time User Goals

1. As a first time user, I want to know what the quiz is about and how to play.

   1. When opened on all device types, users are greeted to the quiz with three prominent buttons, "begin quiz", "how to play" and "maestro". Selecting "how to play" opens a modal which introduces users to the game and literally describes how to play the game. [View Index Here](https://github.com/donovanainsley/movie-maestro/blob/main/assets/testing/am-i-responsive.png). [View Modal Here](https://github.com/donovanainsley/movie-maestro/blob/main/assets/testing/am-i-responsive-modal.png).

1. As a first time user, I want the quiz to be fun and engaging.

   1. This is accomplished solely through design. I've had several people test the quiz and compliment its design and aesthetics but I'm also aware everyones tastes are different.

1. As a first time user, I want to navigate through the quiz quickly and easily.

   1. This is achieved through the use of clearly labelled buttons with font awesome icons used to support the labelling with "begin quiz" having a gamepad icon, "how to play" an encircled question mark and "maestro" a crown. [View Here](https://github.com/donovanainsley/movie-maestro/blob/main/assets/testing/am-i-responsive.png).

   1. When playing the game, each available answer is labelled A to D. When selecting the correct answer the button will flash green [view here](https://github.com/donovanainsley/movie-maestro/blob/main/assets/testing/correct-button.png) before moving on and red [view here](https://github.com/donovanainsley/movie-maestro/blob/main/assets/testing/incorrect-button.png) if the selected answer is incorrect. This allows user move through the quiz quickly and easily.

   1. When users have completed the quiz, they arrive at end.html, where they're invited to save their score, play again or return to the home screen. Each of these buttons is aligned with a font awesome icon to support its intent, the "save" button having a floppy disk, "play again" a gamepad and "home" a house. [View Here](https://github.com/donovanainsley/movie-maestro/blob/main/assets/testing/end-buttons.png)

### Returning User Goals

   1. As a returning user, I want to view my previous scores so that I may improve them.

      1. When users have completed the quiz, they arrive at end.html where they're invited to enter their username [view here](https://github.com/donovanainsley/movie-maestro/blob/main/assets/testing/end-buttons.png) which will then be stored to the local storage and displayed in scores.html, which they are automatically taken too when the select the save button.[View Here](https://github.com/donovanainsley/movie-maestro/blob/main/assets/testing/scores.png).
   
   1. As a returning user, I'd like there to be a large pool of questions available to keep the game challenging and replayable.

      1. This is accomplished with the let questions array in game.js [view here](https://github.com/donovanainsley/movie-maestro/blob/main/assets/scripts/game.js).
   
### Frequent User Goals

   - Frequent user goals would be the same as a returning user, due to the basic nature of the quiz.

### Further Testing

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Macbook Pro, iPad, and Samsung Galaxy S20+.
- Friends and Code Institue peers were asked to review the site to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

- When validating code for index.html, an error was shown regarding the aria-labelledby attribute in the how to play modal incorrectly labelled. I provided the correct label and no further errors were shown. [View here](https://github.com/donovanainsley/movie-maestro/blob/main/assets/testing/index-validator-final-result.png)

- When validating style.css, errors were shown for text-shadow in #game-heading and transform in .choice-container:hover. When correcting the text-shadow error, I realised I didn't like this part of the styling and completely removed it and corrected transform: transform 100ms to transition: transform 100ms. [View here](https://github.com/donovanainsley/movie-maestro/blob/main/assets/testing/css-validator-final-result.png)

- When testing game.js, warnings were given for missing semi-colons and to change selectedChoice.dataset['number'] using dot notation to selectedChoice.dataset.number. To see changes [View here](https://github.com/donovanainsley/movie-maestro/blob/main/assets/testing/game-js-validator-final-result.png).

- When testing end.js, warnings were showing for missing semi-colons and the variable "MAX_HIGH_SCORES = 5" was unused. I input the missing semi-colons and initially commented out the unused variable to ensure it wouldn't create any issues with the remaining code. Once I ran through the the quiz I concluded that the removal of "MAX_HIGH_SCORES = 5" didn't create any issues and permanently removed the variable from end.js. [View here](https://github.com/donovanainsley/movie-maestro/blob/main/assets/testing/end-js-validator-final-result.png).

- When testing scores.js, warnings for missing semi-colons were shown. Once the semi-colons were input the warnings were removed. [View here](https://github.com/donovanainsley/movie-maestro/blob/main/assets/testing/scores-js-validator-final-result.png).
