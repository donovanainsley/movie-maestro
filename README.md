- ### Design

  - #### Colour Scheme

  The main colours used are white, caramel, school bus yellow, penn red and space cadet. I chose these colours after finding the background image for the website [here](https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/videotape-with-clapperboard-3d-glasses_4305082.htm?query=video%20tape%20with%20popcorns#from_view=detail_alsolike) and it triggered a thought to the Quinten Tarantino movies Kill Bill and Pulp fiction, which is when I decided to google and then use the Pulp Fiction colour palette throughout the webste.

  - #### Typography

    - The Merriweather font is the main font used throughout the website excluding the heading which is Rubik Mono One, which I stumbled across when using google fonts and thought it was brilliant for a header. I chose Merriweather after Googling the best Google fonts for websites and come across an article by Newbird which can be found [here](https://newbird.com/best-google-fonts-to-use-on-your-website/) where it was selected 1st of the 8 best Google fonts. As Merriweather is a Serif style font, I chose Sans-Serif as a backup font as it is considered the most web-safe font for readability.

  - #### Imagery

    - The background image was found on Freepik [here](https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/videotape-with-clapperboard-3d-glasses_4305082.htm?query=video%20tape%20with%20popcorns#from_view=detail_alsolike).

    - The favicon was found from a google search for "clapperboard favicon" and can be found [here](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/clapperboard_371869?term=film+clapper&page=1&position=34&origin=tag&related_id=371869).
